# Random Forest Project 

For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.

Lending club had a [very interesting year in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club#2016), so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.

We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) or just use the csv already provided. It's recommended you use the csv provided as it has been cleaned of NA values.

Here are what the columns represent:
* credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
* purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other").
* int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.
* installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.
* log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.
* dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).
* fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.
* days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.
* revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).
* revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).
* inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.
* delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.
* pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).

# Import Libraries

**Import the usual libraries for pandas and plotting. You can import sklearn later on.**


```python

```

## Get the Data

** Use pandas to read loan_data.csv as a dataframe called loans.**


```python

```

** Check out the info(), head(), and describe() methods on loans.**


```python

```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 9578 entries, 0 to 9577
    Data columns (total 14 columns):
    credit.policy        9578 non-null int64

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's do some data visualization! We'll use seaborn and pandas built-in plotting capabilities, but feel free to use whatever library you want. Don't worry about the colors matching, just worry about getting the main idea of the plot.

** Create a histogram of two FICO distributions on top of each other, one for each credit.policy outcome.**

*Note: This is pretty tricky, feel free to reference the solutions. You'll probably need one line of code for each histogram, I also recommend just using pandas built in .hist()*


```python

```

** Create a similar figure, except this time select by the not.fully.paid column.**


```python

```




    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0x11a2cdd30>




![png](02-Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project_files/02-Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project_12_1.png)


** Create a countplot using seaborn showing the counts of loans by purpose, with the color hue defined by not.fully.paid. **


```python

```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x11a508cf8>

** Let's see the trend between FICO score and interest rate. Recreate the following jointplot.**


```python

```




    <seaborn.axisgrid.JointGrid at 0x11a87d7f0>

** Create the following lmplots to see if the trend differed between not.fully.paid and credit.policy. Check the documentation for lmplot() if you can't figure out how to separate it into columns.**


```python

```

# Setting up the Data

Let's get ready to set up our data for our Random Forest Classification Model!

**Check loans.info() again.**


```python

```

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 9578 entries, 0 to 9577
    Data columns (total 14 columns):
    credit.policy        9578 non-null int64
    purpose              9578 non-null object
    int.rate             9578 non-null float64
    installment          9578 non-null float64
    log.annual.inc       9578 non-null float64
    dti                  9578 non-null float64
    fico                 9578 non-null int64
    days.with.cr.line    9578 non-null float64
    revol.bal            9578 non-null int64
    revol.util           9578 non-null float64
    inq.last.6mths       9578 non-null int64
    delinq.2yrs          9578 non-null int64
    pub.rec              9578 non-null int64
    not.fully.paid       9578 non-null int64
    dtypes: float64(6), int64(7), object(1)
    memory usage: 1.0+ MB


## Categorical Features

Notice that the **purpose** column as categorical

That means we need to transform them using dummy variables so sklearn will be able to understand them. Let's do this in one clean step using pd.get_dummies.

Let's show you a way of dealing with these columns that can be expanded to multiple categorical features if necessary.

**Create a list of 1 element containing the string 'purpose'. Call this list cat_feats.**


```python

```

**Now use pd.get_dummies(loans,columns=cat_feats,drop_first=True) to create a fixed larger dataframe that has new feature columns with dummy variables. Set this dataframe as final_data.**


```python

```


```python

```

## Train Test Split

Now its time to split our data into a training set and a testing set!

** Use sklearn to split your data into a training set and a testing set as we've done in the past.**


```python

```


```python

```

## Training a Decision Tree Model

Let's start by training a single decision tree first!

** Import DecisionTreeClassifier**


```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
```

**Create an instance of DecisionTreeClassifier() called dtree and fit it to the training data.**


```python

```


```python

```




    DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight=None, criterion='gini', max_depth=None,
                max_features=None, max_leaf_nodes=None, min_samples_leaf=1,
                min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,
                presort=False, random_state=None, splitter='best')



## Predictions and Evaluation of Decision Tree
**Create predictions from the test set and create a classification report and a confusion matrix.**


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```

                 precision    recall  f1-score   support
    
              0       0.85      0.81      0.83      2431
              1       0.16      0.20      0.18       443
    
    avg / total       0.74      0.72      0.73      2874
    



```python

```

    [[1980  451]
     [ 355   88]]


## Training the Random Forest model

Now its time to train our model!

**Create an instance of the RandomForestClassifier class and fit it to our training data from the previous step.**


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```




    RandomForestClassifier(bootstrap=True, class_weight=None, criterion='gini',
                max_depth=None, max_features='auto', max_leaf_nodes=None,
                min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2,
                min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, n_estimators=600, n_jobs=1,
                oob_score=False, random_state=None, verbose=0,
                warm_start=False)



## Predictions and Evaluation

Let's predict off the y_test values and evaluate our model.

** Predict the class of not.fully.paid for the X_test data.**


```python

```

**Now create a classification report from the results. Do you get anything strange or some sort of warning?**


```python

```


```python

```

                 precision    recall  f1-score   support
    
              0       0.85      1.00      0.92      2431
              1       0.56      0.01      0.02       443
    
    avg / total       0.80      0.85      0.78      2874
    


**Show the Confusion Matrix for the predictions.**


```python

```

    [[2427    4]
     [ 438    5]]


**What performed better the random forest or the decision tree?**


```python

```

# Great Job!
